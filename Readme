# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Project Description

In this project, we will build an image classification model using PyTorch and the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify these images into their respective categories.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Working with PyTorch's Dataset and DataLoader classes
- Building neural network architectures using torch.nn
- Implementing training and evaluation loops
- Using GPU acceleration (if available)
- Applying data augmentation techniques
- Visualizing training progress and results

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Use torchvision to download and load the CIFAR-10 dataset
   - Create data loaders for training and testing sets
   - Apply data augmentation to the training set

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Design a CNN using PyTorch's nn.Module
   - Include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers

3. **Training:**
   - Define loss function and optimizer
   - Implement the training loop
   - Use learning rate scheduling for better convergence

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess model performance on the test set
   - Calculate accuracy and other relevant metrics

5. **Visualization and Analysis:**
   - Plot training and validation loss curves
   - Visualize model predictions on sample images
   - Analyze model performance across different classes

## Key Classes and Functions

This project will utilize the following PyTorch classes and functions:

1. `torch.nn.Module`
2. `torch.nn.Conv2d`
3. `torch.nn.Linear`
4. `torch.nn.ReLU`
5. `torch.nn.MaxPool2d`
6. `torch.nn.Dropout`
7. `torch.optim.SGD` or `torch.optim.Adam`
8. `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`
9. `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10`
10. `torchvision.transforms`
11. `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
12. `torch.cuda.is_available()`
13. `torch.device`
14. `torchvision.utils.make_grid`
15. `torch.save` and `torch.load`

These components cover the essential aspects of building, training, and 
evaluating a CNN for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset in PyTorch.

## Data Source

The CIFAR-10 dataset is readily available through PyTorch's torchvision package. You don't need to download it separately; the code will automatically download and use the dataset.

To get started, you can use the following code snippet to load the data:
```python
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Python (version 3.8 or 3.9 recommended)
2. CUDA Toolkit (version 11.8 or 12.1 recommended)
3. cuDNN (compatible with your CUDA Toolkit version)


### Installation Steps

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

2. Install necessary packages:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install pillow
pip install tensorboard
pip install jupyter
```
**Replace `cu118` with `cu121` if using CUDA 12.1.**

3. Verify the installation:

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```
**This should return True if CUDA is properly set up.**
